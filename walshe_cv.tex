% Summary Section
\section*{SUMMARY}
Calen Walshe is a survey scientist and applied ML researcher who builds end-to-end systems for turning human feedback into production signals. He combines classical survey methodology, causal inference, and NLP to derive insights from implicit user behavior. At Meta, he leads the design and deployment of scalable pipelines that feed quality metrics and sentiment signals directly into core ranking and recommendation models. He is deeply attuned to measurement reliability, drift detection, and end-to-end observability in real-time serving environments. A data professional who ships, Calen bridges behavioral science and infrastructureâ€”from conceptual survey design to engineering high-performance inference systems.

\section*{EXPERIENCE}

\subsection*{Meta --- Staff Quantitative Researcher}
\textit{Nov 2021 -- Present $\mid$ Bellevue, WA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led quantitative UX research programs measuring ad surface usability and user sentiment by integrating in-product telemetry with high-volume survey instrumentation to pinpoint friction points.
    \item Ran large-scale UX experiments (randomized and quasi-experimental) to evaluate design and policy changes on satisfaction; results steered multi-billion-dollar roadmap decisions.
    \item Defined user experience north-star metrics that translate qualitative insights into production ranking signals; adopted as standards across product and engineering teams.
    \item Built production SQL and Python pipelines that stitch survey feedback with interaction traces, enabling self-serve UX analytics and longitudinal cohort tracking.
    \item Deployed LLM-based classifiers to code millions of open-ended responses and surface emergent UX issues in real time for ranking and policy partners.
    \item Created dashboards aligning design, PM, and engineering stakeholders on journey health metrics; now core to weekly decision rituals.
    \item Partnered with design, policy, and trust teams to embed UX guardrails in feature launches, balancing experience, safety, and implementation cost.
