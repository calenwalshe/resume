% Summary Section
\section*{SUMMARY}
Calen Walshe is a survey scientist and applied ML researcher who builds end-to-end systems for turning human feedback into production signals. He combines classical survey methodology, causal inference, and NLP to derive insights from implicit user behavior. At Meta, he leads the design and deployment of scalable pipelines that feed quality metrics and sentiment signals directly into core ranking and recommendation models. He is deeply attuned to measurement reliability, drift detection, and end-to-end observability in real-time serving environments. A data professional who ships, Calen bridges behavioral science and infrastructure—from conceptual survey design to engineering high-performance inference systems.
